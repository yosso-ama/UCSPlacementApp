<member name="M:UCSPlacementApp.Utilities.CreateButtonDefinition(System.String,System.String,System.String,System.String)">
 <summary>
 Function to simplify the creation of a button definition.  The big advantage
 to using this function is that you don't have to deal with converting images
 but instead just reference a folder on disk where this routine reads the images.
 </summary>
 <param name="DisplayName">
 The name of the command as it will be displayed on the button. 
 </param>
 <param name="InternalName">
 The internal name of the command. This needs to be unique with respect to ALL other
 commands. It's best to incorporate a company name to help with uniqueness.
 </param>
 <param name="ToolTip">
 The tooltip that will be used for the command.
 
 This is optional and the display name will be used as the
 tooltip if no tooltip is specified. Like in the DisplayName argument, you can use
 returns to force line breaks.
 </param>
 <param name="IconFolder">
 The folder that contains the icon files. This can be a full path or a path that is
 relative to the location of the add-in dll. The folder should contain the files 
 16x16.png and 32x32.png. Each command will have its own folder so they can have 
 their own icons.
 
 This is optional and if no icon is specified then no icon will be displayed on the
 button and it will be only text.
 </param>
 <returns>
 Returns the newly created button definition or Nothing in case of failure.
